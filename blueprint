AESTHETIC:
Fonts: Helvetica/Arial, Roboto, Courier New, from the google fonts resources on the readme
White or Light Grey Material Background
Maybe a Material dark / navy background (consider a thinner font if you do this)
Different shades between the rows.

General Design Principles:
-Make it as fast to go through as possible: point user (recruiters hopefully) to resume and projects. Minimalist
-keep it straight down, one page



Fade In (JS / CSS)

Nav Bar: About, Projects, Resume, Contact, Extra (Dropdown): DARK MODE SWITCH, Retro.html
Each are just teleporters, except Resume, which is a direct link.
